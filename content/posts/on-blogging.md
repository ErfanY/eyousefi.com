So it might as well be fit to begin with talking about blogging. Why do we blog, what's the point and why should someone
bother?


## But Why
There are a few compelling arguments, depending on who you ask. 

### Fame
You might do it for fame, not in a negative way at all I mean fame as in trying to be an influencer and have an audience
to talk to and possibly earn money on side or if you are very dedicated or lucky you might even be able to earn solely
based on that. I personally think this might be good as long as you are not writing content just for the sake of having
content out there. I mean you do of course have a set of routines you want to hold on to but if you are forcing yourself
to write, film or create content just because you have to you probably see a quality drop. This is quite interesting as
it is substantially different from the field I work in. As an engineer solving the same problem will be a repetition
that makes you more or less more competent. You might even find new ways to solve it which makes it even better. Now
this doesn't mean writing, filming, creating content does not become better by repetition, on the contrary, I think it
just means that with creative contents you've got to work with it in a more delicate way since quality of your writing
has more impact on you as this is considered your work.

### Self Exposure

### Habits & Routines

## So what
Well
