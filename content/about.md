My name is Erfan Yousefi, as you might already know. I'm an Engineering Manager at a company called Infor with background as Architect and Software Engineer prior to that. But this is not LinkedIn so clearly that was useless to say. 

I'm here to talk about different topics that interest me, primarily software and tech. This is yet another attempt of me trying to begin with a blogging habit that's been on and off over the years.

On a more personal note, I am an avid, professional computer user. My specialties are keyboard, monitor, starting computer, clicking, right clicking and self deprecating humor.

You may contact me to discuss stuff.
